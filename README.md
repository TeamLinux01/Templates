# Templates

## This is used to store the ~/Templates folder for KDE installs.

Recommend forking the project repo first.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Use the green `Code` button on the repo page to get the http or ssh link to paste after the `git clone` command. Replace `[git repo]` with the text copied from the code button.

To get started, remove or rename ~/Templates folder by running the following command:

```bash
mv -v ~/Templates ~/Templates.orginal && git clone [git repo] ~/Templates
```

## Feel free to add Templates in which you find useful.

I will except Pull Requests for general purpose templates.

## Templates with the word `personal` will be ignored via `.gitignore`

This way you don't have to share Templates that are specific to you.

##### .gitignore
