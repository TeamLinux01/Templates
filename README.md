# Templates

## This is used to store the ~/Templates folder for KDE installs.

To get started, remove or rename ~/Templates folder by running the following command:

```bash
mv -v ~/Templates ~/Templates.orginal && git clone https://github.com/TeamLinux01/Templates.git ~/Templates
```

## Feel free to add Templates in which you find useful.

I will except Pull Requests for general purpose templates.

## Templates with the word `personal` will be ignored via `.gitignore`

This way you don't have to share Templates that are specific to you.

##### .gitignore
